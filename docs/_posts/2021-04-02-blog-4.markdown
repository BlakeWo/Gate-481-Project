<h1>Blog 4-SP21</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This week, I set up infrastructure using terraform. We're going to take a deeper look into how I did this and what you could customize. 

<h2>Terraform Initalize</h2>
The best first thing that you need to do is setup terraform by downloading it from their official website. Depending on your operating system, you might need a different version. 

<h2>First Terraform file</h2>
First, you want to run terraform init in whatever folder that's going to contain your terraform file. This will setup everything you need to launch the file. After that, you need to create the file with <name>.tf. After creation, you can then edit this file in whatever text editor that you prefer. 

<h2>Terraform Plan</h2>
In this example, let's just setup an EC2 instance. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
